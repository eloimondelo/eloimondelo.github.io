# About Me

Hello! I'm Eloi, a Software Developer with an affinity for animation and teaching. Welcome to my personal website, where I share my experiences and insights from the world of technology.

## My Background

Coding has always intrigued me. I've journeyed through the world of Software Development, exploring different facets of this dynamic field. From crafting efficient algorithms to shaping user-friendly interfaces, I've enjoyed the challenges and creative opportunities that come with the territory.

## Exploring Animation

Animation is one of my interests. The process of bringing elements to life through code is fascinating. Whether it's designing eye-catching visuals or experimenting with interactive animations, I find joy in exploring the artistic side of technology.

## Sharing Knowledge

Teaching is another facet I've explored. Passing on what I've learned is fulfilling. Through workshops, tutorials, and discussions, I've had the chance to guide others in the realms of programming and animation. Witnessing the "aha" moments is a gratifying experience.
